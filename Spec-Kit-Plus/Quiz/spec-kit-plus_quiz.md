## Question 2
Which command is used to establish foundational governing principles in a Spec Kit Plus project?

A) /sp.specify
B) /sp.plan
C) /sp.constitution
D) /sp.implement

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: The `/sp.constitution` command establishes project governing principles including core values, constraints, quality standards, and architectural principles that guide all subsequent development.

---

## Question 3
What does "spec-driven development" prioritize?

A) Writing code first, then documenting it afterward
B) Creating comprehensive specifications before implementation begins
C) Using only manual coding without AI assistance
D) Avoiding documentation to accelerate development

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Spec-driven development inverts traditional workflows by prioritizing the creation of comprehensive specifications before implementation, making specs the foundation for AI-generated code.

---

## Question 4
How many AI coding agents does Spec Kit Plus integrate with?

A) Only Claude Code
B) 5 agents
C) 15+ agents
D) Exactly 10 agents

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Spec Kit Plus integrates with 15 or more AI coding agents including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, and Qwen Code, providing multi-agent compatibility.

---

## Question 5
What is the shorthand command alias used in Spec Kit Plus?

A) sk
B) sp
C) spec
D) kit

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: All Spec Kit Plus commands use the shorthand alias `sp`, making commands like `/sp.specify` instead of the longer `/specifyplus.specify`.

---

## Question 6
In the context of Spec Kit Plus, what problem does the framework address according to its core philosophy?

A) How to write code faster without AI
B) How to eliminate all human involvement in software development
C) If AI writes the code, what is left for a developer to do?
D) How to replace specifications with automated testing

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: The framework addresses "If AI writes the code, what is left for a developer to do?" by emphasizing strategic problem-solving, system architecture, diagnostics, and technical governance.

---

## Question 7
Which of the following is NOT a core workflow command in Spec Kit Plus?

A) /sp.constitution
B) /sp.deploy
C) /sp.specify
D) /sp.implement

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: The core workflow commands are `/sp.constitution`, `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, and `/sp.implement`. `/sp.deploy` is not a core workflow command.

---

## Question 8
What is the purpose of the `/sp.analyze` command?

A) To generate new code implementations
B) To validate cross-artifact consistency
C) To create user documentation
D) To deploy applications to production

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: The `/sp.analyze` command performs cross-artifact consistency validation, identifying discrepancies between requirements, architecture, plans, implementations, tests, and documentation.

---

## Question 9
Which technology provides state management and concurrency control for agent-based systems in Spec Kit Plus?

A) Docker containers
B) Kubernetes pods
C) Dapr Actors
D) Ray clusters

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Dapr Actors provide state management and concurrency control for agent-based systems, enabling each AI agent to be implemented as an actor with location transparency.

---

## Question 10
What does it mean that Spec Kit Plus treats artifacts as "first-class citizens"?

A) Only code receives version control and review
B) Documentation is optional and not tracked
C) Specifications, architecture, prompts, tests, and evaluations receive equal importance to code
D) Tests are more important than specifications

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: First-class artifact status means specifications, architecture history, prompts, tests, and evaluations receive equal treatment with code through version control, peer review, and automated validation.

---

## Question 11
In a "0-to-1 greenfield development" phase, which workflow emphasis is most appropriate?

A) Analyze → Clarify → Specify → Plan → Implement
B) Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
C) Implement → Analyze → Clarify → Iterate
D) Specify (minimal) → Implement → Analyze

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Greenfield projects benefit from comprehensive upfront specification with the workflow: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement, taking advantage of architectural freedom.

---

## Question 12
What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) used for in Spec Kit Plus?

A) Managing database connections
B) Standardizing context management across model interactions
C) Compressing large code files
D) Encrypting sensitive data

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: MCP is a standardized protocol for managing context across model interactions, ensuring consistency in long-running conversations and enabling agents to share consistent project understanding.

---

## Question 13
Which installation method would you use to run Spec Kit Plus without permanent installation?

A) pip install specifyplus
B) npm install spec-kit-plus
C) uvx specifyplus
D) docker pull specifyplus

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: The `uvx specifyplus` command runs Spec Kit Plus using the UV package runner without permanent installation, ideal for experimentation or temporary usage.

---

## Question 14
How does agent-agnostic architecture benefit users of Spec Kit Plus?

A) It requires using only one specific AI provider
B) It provides vendor independence, capability optimization, and redundancy
C) It eliminates the need for human oversight
D) It reduces the number of required specifications

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Agent-agnostic architecture provides vendor independence (avoiding lock-in), capability optimization (selecting best tools per task), redundancy (alternatives if one fails), and comparative evaluation opportunities.

---

## Question 15
What happens when the `/sp.analyze` command detects inconsistencies between artifacts?

A) It automatically deletes the inconsistent artifacts
B) It provides identification, classification, recommendations, and guided resolution
C) It stops all development work immediately
D) It ignores the inconsistencies and continues

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: When inconsistencies are detected, the system provides precise identification with references, severity classification, resolution recommendations, and interactive guided workflows to update artifacts.
